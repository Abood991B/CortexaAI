        "Defined a precise function signature with type hints and an optional `reverse` parameter for sorting order.",
        "Specified the programming language (Python 3.x) for the implementation.",
        "Defined a precise function signature (`def sort_list(data: list) -> list:`) including type hints, removing ambiguity about input/output.",
        "Required the selection of a specific comparison-based sorting algorithm (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort) and its explicit mention/justification.",
        "Added a clear problem statement defining the core task and the role of 'Leap Sort'.",
        "Specified the programming language (Python 3.9+) for implementation.",
        "Defined the exact function signature, including type hints for arguments and return value.",
        "**Correctness:** Added explicit verification methods (unit tests, comparison to expected results) and emphasized strict adherence to the defined algorithm's logic, even if it's not the most performant general sort.",
        "**Efficiency:** Specified that actual performance should align with theoretical complexities, mentioned profiling, and added a constraint to avoid unnecessary operations that degrade performance beyond the algorithm's inherent nature.",
        "**Readability & Maintainability:** Reinforced PEP 8 adherence, added requirements for modularity, clear separation of concerns, descriptive naming, and ease of future modification/debugging."
