        "Specified the programming language (Python 3.9+) to remove ambiguity.",
        "Defined a precise function signature with type hints and an optional `reverse` parameter for sorting order.",
        "Specified the programming language (Python 3.x) for the implementation.",
        "Defined a precise function signature (`def sort_list(data: list) -> list:`) including type hints, removing ambiguity about input/output.",
        "Required the selection of a specific comparison-based sorting algorithm (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort) and its explicit mention/justification."
